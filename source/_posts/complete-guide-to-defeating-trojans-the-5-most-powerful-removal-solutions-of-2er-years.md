## What is a Trojan Virus?

![](https://malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/trojan.png)

A Trojan virus is a type of malicious software that aims to mislead the users. It is also known as Trojan Horse or simply, Trojan. This word comes from the wooden horse which deceptively led to the fall of the city of Troy.

It often disguises itself as legitimate software. In itself, Trojan viruses are harmless. Its primary purpose is to be used by cybercriminals as gateways to your system. Trojans can spy on you when activated. It can collect valuable data and send it to a third-party server.

Modern variations of Trojans are even more dangerous. It can create backdoor access to your computer. Then, it can allow hackers to take full control of your computer. Additionally, Trojans may collect system information to uncover vulnerabilities. The data collected is used to develop ransomware, viruses, and other malicious software.

Trojan viruses are virtually undetectable in most systems. That is why it is crucial to install anti-malware tools for protection.

## #1: MalwareFox

MalwareFox is a complete anti-malware solution. It is always ready for modern malware attacks. It combines the best malware detection, removal, and real-time protection.

Installation is very simple and straightforward. It does not come with bundled bloatware unlike most security systems around.

MalwareFox’s strengths lie in its detection and real-time protection. The manual scan is high-speed. The simple user-interface presents system statistics effectively. It is also very light-weight.

![](https://malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/MalwareFox-1.jpg)

MalwareFox is barely noticeable even during active scans. This feature allows you to open other applications while waiting for the scan to finish. Its precise and efficient detection makes malware removal quick and painless.

Real-time protection prevents malicious applications from penetrating your computer. It even protects your browser from possible threats. MalwareFox removes ads and unnecessary toolbars.

MalwareFox handles advanced and new threats. Its Ransomware protection from ever infiltrating your system.

## #2: Spybot – Search & Destroy

Spybot – Search & Destroy is first malware protection launched. It is one of the biggest names in malware security systems. It also features simple interface and easy-to-use processes. Spybot can remove applications which are monitoring your computer activities. It also offers Immunization Tools which add another layer of protection. Manuals scans are effective and thorough.

![](https://malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Spybot-e1509449948666.jpg)

However, there’s a trade-off in speed as it is [resource intensive](http://www.techradar.com/reviews/spybot-search-destroy). Updates are far in between as well. Every day, we see new threats. Patches should be available at regular intervals.

## #3: SUPERAntiSpyware

SUPERAntiSpyware presents various options to the user. Just like Spybot, it is also an industry veteran. It aims to give you control for effective spyware, adware, trojan and other malware detection and removal. Its installation is quite fast and easy. SuperAntiSpyware’s System Investigator allows manual detection of malicious threats. Scanning is also quick and intuitive.

Unfortunately, active scanning [takes a while](http://download.cnet.com/SuperAntiSpyware-Free-Edition/3000-8022%5F4-10523889.html) to finish fully. Real-time protection is decent, but average at best. Spybot is an anti-malware utility which you can not consider as a full security suite. The interface is user-friendly. However, feels a little dated.

## #4: Malwarebytes

Malwarebytes is currently one of the known free anti-malware tools. Installation is swift and straightforward. It even runs when the operating system is in Safe Mode. It is relatively lightweight as well. Manual scans are not resource-intensive, too. Malwarebytes also improve its user interface to be intuitive. Its real-time malware blocking and malicious URL blocking is also quite useful.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

However, other products prove to have a [more efficient](http://sea.pcmag.com/malwarebytes-anti-malware-premium-20) real-time solution. Additionally, Malwarebytes cannot be your computer’s lone protection. You should have a first security suite installed along with Malwarebytes. Real-time protection also expires after 14 days.

## #5: Emsisoft Emergency Kit

Emsisoft Emergency Kit may not be as advanced as the other tools, but it gets the job done. It provides essential Trojan scanning and removal function. One of its unique features is the ability to run as a portable app. You can save it on a thumb drive and run it on a computer without the need to install.

Additionally, command line options are available for pro users. Its BlitzBank feature deletes threats on boot-up. Emsisoft quarantines threats even before it targets security software.

![](https://malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Emsisoft-Emergency-Kit-e1509450019182.png)

On the other hand, it [does not provide continuous protection](http://www.techradar.com/reviews/emsisoft-emergency-kit). Emsisoft Emergency Kit is only suitable as a last resort solution for infected computers. It does deep scan well. However, it is not for everyday security use.

## Final Thoughts

Trojan viruses are the first threat that will try to penetrate your operating system. It relies on the ability to fool you from installing it on your system. Some legitimate applications may even come bundled with Trojan Horse. Toolbars and other add-ons may also occur with potent versions of Trojan viruses.

Its ability to remain unnoticed for a long time makes it very threatening. Relying only on the essential protection of the operating system is apparently not enough. Trojan Horses increases your system’s vulnerability a hundredfold. It can create wider backdoors and security holes. More menacing applications such as viruses, ransomware, and rootkits.

Protecting your computer from Trojan viruses should be one of the first layers of protection. Trojan infections can open your system to a large number of threats. Hackers will take advantage of the vulnerabilities and security holes in the system. Having the best Trojan removal application is necessary prevention that you should have.

WOW. I have tried so many other antivirus softwares, none of which were able to get rid of the Trojan. I just read this page, hoping to find a tool to help me. I downloaded Malwarefox and that was the best thing i could’ve done to get my PC back on track. I ran the lightweight program and it completely took it out. Thank You Malwarefox!

With the rise of malware affecting more and more users, computer security and personal vigilance are more important than ever before. It’s best you reach out to blackrock consult pro and hire an expert for top firewall security, database/fund recovery (if you have been hacked or scammed) and stealth investigation services for individuals and institutions based on preferences and requests.

I don’t see “GridinSoft” here? You may get to know it.  
They found endless amount of Trojans, along with a lot of other crap that the others completely missed!!! Actually back in the day when my mums browsers got hijacked all these blow up fish couldn’t resolve it either, and that is how I discovered “GridinSoft” in the first.  
I have “Malwarebytes” installed – Missed everything  
I have “GridinSoft Anti-Malware” – Missed everything  
I have “Trojan Killer Portable Edition” – Boom 100 threats 50%+ Trojans including untouched compressed files.

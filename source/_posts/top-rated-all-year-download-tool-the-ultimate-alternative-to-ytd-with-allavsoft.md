* My Windows Media Player can not play the downloaded video with YTD video downloader, which troubles me a lot. Why? Is there an easy solution?
* I found YTD video downloader supported websites are very limited. And it can not help me to download videos from Lynda, CBS, Udemy, Vevo and more. Why YTD video downloader can not download these above videos, just like other video downloaders do?
* I find the video quality downloaded by YTD video downloader is lower than the original one. How to fix it? That is right.

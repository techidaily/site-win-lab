These are typically triggered by a [Trojan](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/). More often than not, alerts from these malicious programs are quite aggressive possibly to overcompensate its ineffectiveness. Some fake antivirus actually infects computers during its installation. An increase of pop-ups and other alerts also come with the fake antivirus. The malware uses valuable system resources every time it creates a pop-up. Your system will significantly slow down even with very few applications running. Check your Task Manager to confirm all the running programs. If you cannot access your Task Manager from the [usual methods](https://www.windowschimp.com/windows-10-tutorials-36-how-to-access-the-task-manager/), then it is a clear sign that your computer is infected with a virus or malware.

You can use [Internet monitoring tools](https://www.windowschimp.com/internet-traffic-monitoring-tools/) to best see which programs are consuming the most bandwidth. Lastly, an increase of adverts while browsing the Internet can be a sign of infection.

You may be redirected to websites that you haven’t visited in the past. Typically, these websites will convince you to download more applications, enter your personal information, and even mimic other legitimate websites to gather more information about you.

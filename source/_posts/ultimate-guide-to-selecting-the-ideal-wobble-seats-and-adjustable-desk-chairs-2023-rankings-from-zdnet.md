Pros & Cons 

**Pros** 
* Tested by the Mayo Clinic and Neat-certified
* Tall maximum height of 32.25 inches
* Norwegian titling saddle seat design
* Better than average warranty

**Cons** 
* It's expensive
* Low weight capacity for cost

More Details 

**Features:**

The Varier Move was first manufactured in 1985\. This elegant standing desk chair utilizes a high-quality design and build to provide a tested active seating experience. While many wobble stools are ergonomic and can promote active sitting, the Varier is rare in that it has been tested by the Mayo Clinic and has received a Neat certification. For a product to earn this honor, it must increase energy use over sitting by more than 10%. 

With an easily adjustable height range of 22 inches to 32.35 inches, the Varier Move is made to fit a diversity of workspaces. The saddle shape design of the seat can provide an extra sense of comfort and support. However, not everyone finds these designs preferable. While this stool offers more than most, it also comes with a significantly steeper price tag than many competitors.

The Varier Move Tilting Saddle Stool was chosen as 'best overall' due to its high-quality production, time-tested design, impressive height range, and Neat certification. While its price is a barrier, we feel its merits more than outweigh that downside.

The height adjustment lever is a circular bar beneath the seat, within easy reach of your hands while sitting. That can make it easier to adjust height without needing to rise fully, although one should still take their weight off of the seat first for safety reasons.

Sun-Flex

Pros & Cons 

**Pros** 
* Height adjustable
* Moderate weight capacity at 264 pounds
* Full horizontal swiveling
* Low price point

**Cons** 
* It doesn't have tilting features
* The maximum height is only 27.9 inches

More Details 

**Features:**

* Maximum load of 264 lbs
* An anti-skid surface on the base to protect floors and prevent falling
* Full horizontal swiveling
* Height adjustable up to 27.9 inches

The Sun-Flex Ergonomic Height Adjustable Balance Foot Stool is the most affordable of our final five wobble stools. While this product offers a more barebones experience than the Seville Classics stool, it is in a similar vein. However, the Sun-Flex does have a higher maximum weight capacity than many alternatives, at 264 pounds.

This standing desk chair has an anti-skid base to prevent the chair from scratching the floor or falling over while you lean in it. The seat can swivel around a full 360 degrees, but there is no seat-specific tilt function. The seat can be adjusted from 24.5 inches up to 27.9 inches using an easy-to-reach lever.

The Sun-Flex Ergonomic Height Adjustable Balance Foot Stool was selected as 'best for affordability' due to its deliverance of core active sitting features at a highly affordable price, without sacrificing much beyond caveats. For those who want to try using a wobble stool and see if it may be right for them, this stool may serve as an excellent entry piece.

Galam

Pros & Cons 

**Pros** 
* High weight capacity of 300 pounds
* Ergonomic seat design that allows the body to tilt without shifting the stool
* High maximum height of 33 inches

**Cons** 
* Wheels can make balancing tricky, even with locks

More Details 

**Features:** 

* The seat is a half-dome inflatable standing desk stool
* Adjustable height up to 33 inches with a hydraulic system
* Full horizontal swivel, five-wheel base with locks
* 300-lbs maximum capacity

The Gaiam Balance Ball Chair Stool offers an unusual mix of different seating designs. Unlike most wobble stools, the Gaiam has wheeled legs instead of a round base. While the wheels do lock, this can still present some difficulties and potential risks for those who like to lean in their seats. Another unique feature of this stool is the seat, which is a half-dome of inflated balance ball material. Much of the active sitting engagement in this stool comes from the inflatable seat.

This stool is well-designed with quality materials, and its higher-than-usual weight capacity of 300 pounds reflects that. The inflatable seat provides a strong, slightly contouring support that can dissipate heat well. However, the tradeoff with an inflatable seat is that the rubber material of these seats does not breathe.

The Gaiam Balance Ball Chair Stool offers the greatest weight capacity and some of the tallest height options of our final five stools. Although its wheeled design breaks partly with the tradition of standing desk chairs, this stool still offers the same active sitting engagement, thanks, in part, to the inflatable seat.

## What is the best standing desk chair?

The Varier Move Tilting Saddle Stool was our choice for best overall due to its Neat-certification, impressive history within the ergonomic seating industry, high-quality manufacturing, ergonomic saddle seat design, and tall maximum height. 

The high cost of this stool, when compared to alternatives, can be prohibitive, however. Still, despite its higher price, the Varier Move provides nearly everything a standing desk chair should, with style and quality.

## How did I choose these standing desk chairs?

The above chairs were reviewed considering these comparative factors: ergonomic design, comfort, maximum height, maximum weight capacity, tilt and swivel functions, stability, style, and price. Initially, a broad range of wobble stools was considered. Then, those were winnowed down to five finalists using the above criteria.

These final five were then compared to each within this review using the same criteria as above. Of the five, one was selected as ZDNET's top choice for best overall. The four runner-ups were each chosen for exemplification within a specific parameter or a specific demographic. For example, while the Varier Move was selected for "best overall," the Sun-Flex was chosen as "best for affordability."

Some variables were given more weight than others, with ergonomic design and function being treated as the most important. Maximum weight capacity and height maximums were weighted as the next most important variables. For the most part, the price was relatively consistent between a majority of standing desk chair options, with some notable exceptions.

## Are standing desk chairs and wobble stools suitable for all body types?

Standing desk chairs and wobble stools can benefit a wide range of body types. t's important to check the weight capacity of the product and ensure that it is appropriate for your body size.

## What is the difference between a standing desk chair and a wobble stool?

The main difference between a standing desk chair and a wobble stool is the design of the seat. A standing desk chair typically has a more traditional seat with a backrest, while a wobble stool often has a round or saddle-shaped seat that is designed to promote active sitting and movement while working. Wobble stools also usually have a base that allows for rocking and tilting, while standing desk chairs have a more stable base. Additionally, standing desk chairs are often more expensive than wobble stools due to their added features and higher-end materials.

## In what way are wobble stools better than ordinary chairs?

Wobble stools use ergonomic design to enable and encourage active sitting. Active sitting means your core and legs continue to be active and engaged while sitting. Active sitting can help promote healthy blood circulation, better spinal alignment, and posture. In turn, it gives your body more fluidity with a standing chair as opposed to a traditional office chair. 

## How do standing desk chairs work?

These ergonomic seats encourage your body's core to stay engaged while you sit in them. By placing your feet solidly on the floor and sitting on one of these stools, you can wobble, tilt, and rotate yourself and the seat around. Doing this engages your body and practices balance.

## Do I need a standing desk to use a standing desk chair?

Standing desk office chairs are often designed with standing desks or similar structures in mind. 

**Also: [The 7 best standing desks](https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/smart-office/best-standing-desks/)** 

However, they can fit with numerous types of desks, counters, and tables. You'll want some open space underneath the surface you intend to work at, allowing for leg and leaning room. Other than that, it's essential to make sure the height of your stool and work surface will work together.

## How to Remove Redirect Virus from your Android Phone?

Removing the redirect malware from an Android phone is relatively easy. You just have to identify which application is the culprit and then uninstall it. However, some people might find it challenging to recognise malicious app.

_**Note:** Settings option may be different for different phones as per the manufacturer company. Look for the similar options if you can’t find the exact one._

1\. You might have installed an app recently, and just after that, redirection and pop-ups started. You quickly know which app is the one causing that.

2\. If the ad is stuck on your notification panel, you can long-press on it, and depending on your phone settings, you will get an option to know which app is causing that notification.

3\. If you still could not find the accused application, check the battery consumption details. If you find an app or apps consuming battery even though you are not using it, then it is the one. For checking the battery usage go to Settings -> Battery and check for usage status. If you have charged your phone recently, then wait for at least 45 minutes for proper monitoring. 

![](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Check-Battery-Usage.jpg)

4\. Check the internet data usage. If you find an app whose data usage is suspicious, then it is the culprit. To check data usage go to **Settings** \-> **Network & Internet** \-> **Data usage** \-> **Mobile data usage / WiFi data usage.** [](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/)

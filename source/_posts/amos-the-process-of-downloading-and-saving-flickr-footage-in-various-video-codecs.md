### Brief Introduction to Flickr

Created by a company named Ludicorp from Canada in 2004, Flickr originally is a chat room for real-time photo exchange. After purchased by Yahoo in 2005, now Flickr has become a popular social networking website for image sharing.

Apart from image sharing service, Flickr also supports video uploading and video sharing. However, until now, the Flickr video is not available to be downloaded directly, in other words, users have to find a third-party app to download videos from Flickr.

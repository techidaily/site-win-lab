## PC App Store in Details

PC App store generates revenue by promoting malicious programs which puts your system at the risk of adware, browser hijacker, PUA, trojan, ransomware, and other infections.

In addition to promoting content that could be harmful, sites that are promoted can collect data (which may include personal information) and share it with third parties (potentially, cyber criminals).

Also, PC App Store likely has the ability to track data, which is common for software like this. Geolocations, language settings, operating system and browser types (e.g., sites visited, pages viewed, search queries, [cookies](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/), web beacons, browsing history, usernames/passwords, etc.), personally identifiable information, credit card numbers, and so on may be among the data that is collected. This sensitive information can be sold to third parties or used in other ways to make money.

Cybercriminals often use legal platforms (like [Microsoft Store](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/apps), [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/extensions), [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps), etc.) to spread unwanted and harmful content. The review teams can quickly get rid of harmful apps and extensions, which makes this method of distribution not very long-lasting. But that doesn’t stop the abuse, because making it look like it’s legal can draw in a lot of possible victims.
